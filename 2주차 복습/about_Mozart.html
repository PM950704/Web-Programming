        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>
          Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on 27 January 1756 to Leopold Mozart
          (1719–1787) and Anna Maria, née Pertl (1720–1778), at Getreidegasse 9
          in Salzburg.[3] Salzburg was the capital of the Archbishopric of
          Salzburg, an ecclesiastic principality in the Holy Roman Empire (today
          in Austria). He was the youngest of seven children, five of whom died
          in infancy. His elder sister was Maria Anna Mozart (1751–1829),
          nicknamed "Nannerl". Mozart was baptised the day after his birth, at
          St. Rupert's Cathedral in Salzburg. The baptismal record gives his
          name in Latinized form, as Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus
          Mozart. He generally called himself "Wolfgang Amadè Mozart"[4] as an
          adult, but his name had many variants.

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          Mozart was nursed in his final days by his wife and her youngest
          sister, and was attended by the family doctor, Thomas Franz Closset.
          He was mentally occupied with the task of finishing his Requiem, but
          the evidence that he dictated passages to his student Franz Xaver
          Süssmayr is minimal.[85] Mozart died in his home on 5 December 1791
          (aged 35) at 12:55 am.

          He composed more than 600 songs, encompassing a variety of genres,
          including opera, marches, orchestral dances, piano concertos, violin
          concertos, vocal music for churches, cantatas, and masses, and left
          them to future generations.

      <h3>The legend of Mozart's death</h3>
      <p>
        It was said that it rained and thundered on the day of Mozart's funeral,
        but according to New Groove, it was actually a clear, cloudless day.
